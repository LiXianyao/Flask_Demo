pdfminer3k is a Python 3 port of pdfminer.
PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting 
and analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain
the exact location of texts in a page, as well as 
other information such as fonts or lines.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files
into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
PDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.

We had to forked this because original package was removed from pypi
